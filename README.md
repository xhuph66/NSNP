# NSNP
# Usage
- The file ***NSNP.py*** is the main program to perform forecasting time series by using NSNP system.
- Defining the basic functions of an NSNP, *NSNPs.py* is used in the main program, and there is no need to run it seperately.
- In the function named NSNP the read data needs to be converted into multi-layer data using MATLAB. After being trained by NSNP system,
  the source data can be reconstructed by MATLAB. At this time, use Python to read out the reconstructed data
- the file named ***nsst** :The main function can run the transformation program
